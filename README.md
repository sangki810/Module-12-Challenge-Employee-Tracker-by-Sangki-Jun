# Module 12 Challenge: Employee Tracker by Sangki Jun

This is the completed module 12 challenge from the UCF FSF Bootcamp. The purpose of this assignment was for the creator to practice using mySQL for the first time to store data and run applications using node. This repository was created from scratch but completed with specific instructions from the bootcamp program. The code runs node in the command line to view and update information in the mySQL database.
